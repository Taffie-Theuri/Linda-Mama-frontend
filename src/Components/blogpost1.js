                "Our bodies make milk that is unique for our babies," Carpenter said. "Even if you are only able to bring in a partial supply, both you and your baby benefit. In this time of formula shortage, it may bring us back to relying on our bodies and learning that we can do it."
                For parents who choose to breastfeed, it is often easiest to start right after birth, but it's possible to start later, too.
                "Pregnant parents and recently delivered parents have the highest potential to succeed with proper support," Carpenter said, noting that hospitals have lactation consultants to help you get started and troubleshoot any issues. "If you are further out from delivery, you can do it too. Even non-birth parents and adoptive parents have successfully brought in a milk supply. It takes time and patience, so if you are considering this option, the time to start is now."
                Carpenter noted that it is important to have realistic expectations. Parents who are further out from delivery may take weeks to months to bring in milk supply and it may be in lower volumes.

                If you delivered your baby recently
                If you delivered your baby recently, first see if the baby will latch. This is the best way to bring in a milk supply.
                You'll need to give a bottle of formula after latch at first, but, as breastmilk supply increases, you will need less formula. There are lactation aids that allow formula to be given while baby is at the breast, too. Adding pumping can also help bring the supply in.
                An International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) can help you get started with breastfeeding. Find an IBCLC near you at Pro-LC.org or ILCA.org.

                If you are farther out from delivery
                If your baby will not latch or you are farther out from delivery, you can use pumping to build up a milk supply. Pump after every time your baby eats â€“ typically eight times per day.
                Nearly all insurance providers cover an electric breast pump and your obstetrician's office will write you a prescription for one. You'll then need to contact a durable medical equipment company affiliated with your insurance company to get the pump delivered to you. There are laws in place to support breastfeeding and pumping in public and at work.

                If you are pregnant
                If you are pregnant and had breastfeeding troubles in the past, seek a prenatal consult with an IBCLC. An IBCLC can help you troubleshoot past issues and give you strategies to try after delivery.
                Even if you do not make a full milk supply, you can likely make a partial supply to help feed your baby.
